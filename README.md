# WellSpring
This is my BAIT2073 Mobile Application Development Assignment. This is a step tracking application that will track how many steps you have taken with achievement feature, calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) features and a mini game feature where you can rare different pets, feed them, play with them or even make them wear clothes. With every 100 steps taken, you can earn 1 in-game coin and coins are used to buy foods, toys, clothes, different pets or even voucher codes!</br>

Strength:</br>
⦁ Step tracking that will allow you to earn in-game currency which motivates you to take more steps! </br>
⦁ Mini game features to allow you to interact with your pets. </br>
⦁ Calculate your BMI on the spot with history feature that is presented using graphical mode to track your BMI status. </br>
⦁ Achievement feature that will keep you motivated so you will do more exercises! </br>
⦁ Profile system that allow you to register an account and manage your account easily. </br>

Weakness:</br>
⦁ The voucher code is a random string generated so it is not a real code since this is just a prototype and we have not integrate with any e-commerce applcations yet.
